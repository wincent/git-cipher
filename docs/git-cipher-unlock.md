## Options

### `--force`

If ciphertext versions of managed files exist in the worktree, `git-cipher unlock` will reset them to their decrypted state. However, if the worktree is "dirty" it will abort.

Use the `--force` switch to proceed with the reset even when the worktree is dirty.

(TODO: look at including common options by reference -- ie. replace a link to the common options with the options)
